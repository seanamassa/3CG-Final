# 3CG-Final

3CG - Mythic Clash - CMPM121 Spr25- Tommy Nguyen & Sean Massa

Programming Patterns:

Update Method. Continuously updates game state and frames. Used for input handling State Pattern. States allow for easy input handling (dragging variable) Prototype. Card and Pile objects. This pattern provides easy way to group objects with similar properties. Observer. The game

GAMEPLAY ADDITIONS/CHANGES:

you can discard cards from your hand to free up space (1 card per turn) there are some cards that have abilities that depend on discard.
The project instructions don't really detail much about how cards are discarded so we're taking some creative liberties and having cards discard after that turn's reveal phase is over. This will allow more cards to be cycled through play and we feel it gives some originality to our game.
added deck builder to build a custom deck for play
added game log to show the turn status
